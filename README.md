- `timberz.admin` - Allows the player to use admin commands. (Only for OPs by default)

## Compatability

### ✅ PlaceholderAPI

- `%timberz_can_timber%` - Returns true if the player can use TimberZ. This takes permissions, regions and other restrictions into account.

### ✅ AuraSkills

Using TimberZ with AuraSkills, gives players the correct amount of experience when cutting down trees. You can also add a custom XP multiplier to the TimberZ configuration file.

### ✅ mcMMO

## Configuration

You can find the configuration files in the `plugins/TimberZ` folder. The main configuration file is `config.yml`, and you can also find a `blocks.yml` file that contains the block mappings for logs, leaves, and saplings.
